This is my first microverse project into github.

The content is a HTML and CSS file, two md files and a folder that contain linters file.

Also in adition a file .gitignore that can hide a md file with the content "This file should be ignored by git" and the workflows folder with the linters.

The HTML file only contain a title in h1 that say "Hello Microverse" and, the CSS file class set a font family style and color font.
